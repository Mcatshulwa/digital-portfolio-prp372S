# Digital Portfolio for Work Readiness Training

This digital portfolio is a comprehensive collection of evidence and reflections from my Work Readiness Training. It is structured around the core learning areas and demonstrates my professional development. Each section includes verifiable evidence and a personal reflection using the STAR technique (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to critically analyze my learning journey. All work was completed individually.

## Mock Interview

**Evidence**
A recorded video of a simulated mock interview session is provided here. The video showcases my application of interview skills in a realistic setting.

**Reflection (STAR Technique)**

- **Situation:** I participated in a mock interview conducted to simulate the pressure and format of a real job interview, providing a safe space to apply my learned skills.

- **Task:** My goal was to effectively communicate my suitability for a target role, successfully applying my prepared answers, active listening, and professional demeanour under simulated pressure.

- **Action:** I treated the mock interview as a real one, dressing professionally and preparing accordingly. During the session, I used the STAR method to answer questions, maintained positive body language, and asked relevant questions at the end.

- **Result:** Reviewing the recording provided invaluable feedback on my performance, highlighting strengths in my answer structure and areas for improvement, such as reducing filler words. This experience was critical in bridging the gap between theory and practice.

## Professional Networking

**Evidence**  
Results from a professional networking proficiency quiz, demonstrating my understanding of networking principles, etiquette, and strategies. The quiz covered topics including the purpose of networking, types of networking events, golden rules, common mistakes to avoid, and initial steps in building a professional network.

**Reflection (STAR Technique)**

- **Situation:** As part of the Work Readiness Training, I completed a comprehensive quiz on professional networking to test my knowledge of effective networking strategies and best practices in the modern job market.

- **Task:** I needed to demonstrate my understanding of networking fundamentals, including identifying the primary purposes of professional networking, recognizing appropriate networking behaviors, and understanding the step-by-step process for building valuable professional connections.

- **Action:** I studied networking principles and applied this knowledge to answer quiz questions correctly. This included understanding different types of networking events, learning the "golden rule" of networking (likely focusing on mutual benefit rather than just personal gain), identifying common networking mistakes to avoid, and recognizing the important first steps in creating a professional network.

- **Result:** Successfully completing this quiz provided me with a solid theoretical foundation in professional networking strategies. I now understand how to approach networking opportunities effectively, avoid common pitfalls, and build genuine professional relationships that can support my career growth in the ICT industry.

## Business Communication

**Evidence**  
- Professional slide deck on "Essential Business Communication Skills"
- Recorded presentation video demonstrating verbal and non-verbal delivery
- Business communication principles quiz results

**Reflection (STAR Technique)**

- **Situation:** As part of the Work Readiness Training, I was required to both demonstrate practical business communication skills through a presentation and prove theoretical knowledge through a comprehensive quiz.

- **Task:** I needed to create and deliver a professional presentation on business communication fundamentals while also mastering the core principles of professional communication, virtual etiquette, and appropriate language usage.

- **Action:** I designed and developed a professional slide deck covering key business communication topics, practiced and recorded my presentation delivery, and successfully completed a business communication quiz testing my knowledge of formal language, email tone, non-verbal cues, and virtual meeting standards.

- **Result:** This combination of practical application and theoretical learning equipped me with comprehensive business communication skills. I can now confidently create professional presentations, deliver them effectively using appropriate verbal and non-verbal communication, and apply proper etiquette in emails, virtual meetings, and professional interactions.
