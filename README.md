# Digital Portfolio for Work Readiness Training

This digital portfolio is a comprehensive collection of evidence and reflections from my Work Readiness Training. It is structured around the core learning areas and demonstrates my professional development. Each section includes verifiable evidence and a personal reflection using the STAR technique (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to critically analyze my learning journey. All work was completed individually.
