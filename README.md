# Digital Portfolio for Work Readiness Training

This digital portfolio is a comprehensive collection of evidence and reflections from my Work Readiness Training. It is structured around the core learning areas and demonstrates my professional development. Each section includes verifiable evidence and a personal reflection using the STAR technique (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to critically analyze my learning journey. All work was completed individually.

## Mock Interview

**Evidence**
A recorded video of a simulated mock interview session is provided here. The video showcases my application of interview skills in a realistic setting.

**Reflection (STAR Technique)**

- **Situation:** I participated in a mock interview conducted to simulate the pressure and format of a real job interview, providing a safe space to apply my learned skills.

- **Task:** My goal was to effectively communicate my suitability for a target role, successfully applying my prepared answers, active listening, and professional demeanour under simulated pressure.

- **Action:** I treated the mock interview as a real one, dressing professionally and preparing accordingly. During the session, I used the STAR method to answer questions, maintained positive body language, and asked relevant questions at the end.

- **Result:** Reviewing the recording provided invaluable feedback on my performance, highlighting strengths in my answer structure and areas for improvement, such as reducing filler words. This experience was critical in bridging the gap between theory and practice.
